// Didn't have time to actually implement anything so I wrote some psudocode for how it might work

// Take in nessesary variables from the program
in texture player_sprite;
in int facingDown
in int facingLeft
  
void main()
{
    // Create buffers from the texture to make a red glow around the player and duplicate the player sprite to simulate a trail

    // Create Buffer and scale it slightly higher than the player

    // Change the buffer's color to red

    // Create an array of buffer

    // Incement through array and offet each one based on the direction the player is facing and draw each with decreasing opacity
